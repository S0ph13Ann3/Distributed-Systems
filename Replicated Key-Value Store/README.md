# Team Contributions
- Sophie Hernandez: setting up the github repo, dockerfile, worked on PUT request implementation, implemented casual-meta data, and replication. 
- Kim Pham: modified view operations, added functions for broadcasting + syncing for replicas, added error handling
- Samiyah Shaikh: Worked on DELETE request implementation, implemented initial version of view operations and error-handling

# Mechanism Description
- Our system tracks casual dependencies by associating a version number with each key in the key-value store (kvs) and we store the version number in stringToIntMap variable that key's integer value of its "version." Each keyâ€™s version is incremented with PUT or DELETE requests, and this version number is returned as casual-metadata in responses to indicate the latest state. Also was inspired by Lecture 8. 
- Our system detects when a replica goes down by periodically sending health-check requests to each replica in the view. Specifically, the ReplicaDown function iterates through the current view of replicas (excluding the local replica) and sends an HTTP GET request to the ```/health``` endpoint of each replica. If a response is not received or the status code is not ```200 OK```, the system assumes the replica is down. Upon detecting an unresponsive replica, it removes the replica from the view and broadcasts the updated view to the remaining replicas. This process runs continuously in the background, with a delay of 5 seconds between checks, ensuring the system promptly identifies and adapts to changes in replica availability.
